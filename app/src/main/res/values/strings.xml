    <string name="t1">If your club has a hospital, Dialysis Center, Education Institute etc. and your club keeps adding beneficiaries to the existing project, It is an on going project.
    It is life time project and not a project for the particular year.</string>


    <string name="t2">Any Project that you have conducted before in the same Rotary year under the same or  any other area of focus falls under the category. E.G. : You have conducted
    mask distribution today at railway station and tomorrow the same activity is conducted in another place or you have done one tree plantation in one village last month and you are conducted one more in another village this month,it is a repeat project.</string>


    <string name="t3">  These are just examples. Please upload similar projects conducted in this criteria.</string>

    <string name="t4"> The data I will enter is for a sevice project conducted by my club that has benefitted the community. It is not a club meeting, Fellowship meeting. club
